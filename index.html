currents of nationalism and illiberal beliefs. Anesaki Masaharu (1873–1949), one of Tokyo Imperial
University’s most far-sighted intellectuals, relied on the new sciences of social psychology and
religious studies to answer these questions.
</div><div><br></div><div>Anesaki believed the moral development of the individual to be grounded in spiritual values, and
accordingly brought religious leaders together in state-supported interfaith dialogue. In his view,
religious groups could only triumph over narrow-minded fundamentalism and cultivate good citizens
when they had a healthy liberal democracy backing them, but the health of the state conversely
depended on transcendent values which should be properly identified as religious.
</div><div><br></div><div>These sociological theories intersected with his personal beliefs, a unique mixture of Buddhism,
Shinto, spiritualism, and hope for the future of Japan. Anesaki's political and spiritual theories still
speak to us today as we aim to understand the meaning of liberal democracy in the 21st century.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mr. Avery Morrow</strong> is an incoming Ph.D. candidate at Brown University. His research has been published by
the International Shinto Studies Association, and in Correspondences: Journal for the Study of
 Esotericism as well as other books and journals. His first book, The Sacred Science of Ancient Japan,
analyzed various alternative perspectives on Japanese mythology.</div></div><div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>May 13, 2019 18:30</strong></div><div><strong>Roundtable Discussions for Members: "What's Next for ASJ?

:&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Donald Lawrence Keene&nbsp;</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-size: 0.8rem;"><em>By Erich Berendt, Co-Editor of The Transactions</em></span></strong></div><div><br></div><div>Donald Lawrence Keene (1922-2019) passed away February 24th at the age of 96. Born in New York,
 but reflecting his deep commitment to Japanese language and literature, he became a Japanese citizen in
2012. Dr. Keene has been recognized for his extraordinary contributions in Japanese culture as the most
 important person in the creation and establishment of Japan studies in the West. The New Yorker noted,
“Through his graceful, resourceful translations and his elegant, exhaustive scholarly books he is almost
 single-handedly responsible for the popularity of Japanese literature in English-speaking countries.”
 </div><div><br></div><div>Regarded as a child prodigy, Keene entered Columbia University at the age of sixteen, studying the classics
 of Western literature in particular French and Greek. While browsing in a used bookstore he came across
 The Tale of Genji translated by Arthur Waley, becoming fascinated with the elegance and sophistication of 
Japanese culture. On enlisting in the US Navy, he volunteered to study Japanese, which led to his working
 as an interpreter. After the Second World War, he returned to Columbia University to study Japanese 
literature.
</div><div><br></div><div>Returning to Japan in the 1950s, Keene continued his studies at Kyoto University on a Ford Foundation
scholarship and befriended many famous living authors such as Abe Kobo, Mishima Yukio, Kawabata
Yasunari, Ooka Shohei and Tanizaki Junichiro. Among his notable friends was Nagai Michio who was his
closest friend in Japan. His intense dedication to Japanese literature led him to produce about 25 volumes,
scholarly works, translations and edited anthologies. Perhaps his multi-volume series on the history of
Japanese literature had the greatest impact on the spread of Japanese literary studies, but he had a broad
range of interests including Haikai, Noh theater, Bunraku and wrote an influential monograph series on
modern Japanese writers (Dazai, Mishima, Abe). His work and contributions to the studies of Japanese
culture have been recognized by many prizes and honorary degrees, both in Japan and abroad.
</div><div><br></div><div>The Asiatic Society of Japan has been honored by Professor Keene’s lectures, and he contributed seven
papers to the Transactions journal. In 2002 at the recommendation of the society’s patron Prince
Takamado, he gave the keynote address on the life of Emperor Meiji for the ASJ’s 130th anniversary. More
recently, he was awarded the Prince Takamado Award for his distinguished contributions to Japanese
cultural studies.
Throughout his career, Donald Keene always generously gave advice to aspiring students. No matter how
busy his obligations made him he always was available to friends and colleagues alike. His warm-hearted
humor and humility will long be remembered. His greatest pleasure more than awards was to enjoy good
food and good conversation with friends in Kyoto, Usami and Tokyo, the domiciles of his Japanese soul.
